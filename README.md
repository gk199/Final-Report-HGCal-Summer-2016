# SURF Final Report 2016
## Precision Timing Studies for the High Granularity Calorimeter Using a Dedicated Timing Layer
### Caltech CMS Group, mentored by Prof. Maria Spiropulu

Final report for 2016 Caltech SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship), summarizing work with the Caltech CMS group. This presents results obtained using a dedicated timing silicon layer similar to that proposed to be used in the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) for CMS, focusing on analysis of data from the Fermilab testbeam facility.
